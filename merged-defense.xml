U.S. Space Command and U.K. Space Command completed their first coordinated satellite maneuver from September 4 to 12, marking a significant advance in allied on-orbit operations. The mission demonstrated readiness for responsible, dynamic, and integrated space activities at a time and place of the partners' choosing.

 Russia said a Ukrainian drone barrage triggered power cuts in one of its border regions - one of Kyiv's largest attacks of the war.

 Germany said Thursday it would step up its defences - from drone warfare to outer space - at a time of growing tensions between Russia and NATO while the Ukraine war grinds on. 

Recent weeks have seen Russia send fighter jets and drones into NATO airspace in Poland and Romania, followed by suspicious drone flights near airports in Denmark and Norway.

 Iran does not plan to immediately resume nuclear talks with European nations after they reimposed sanctions, the foreign ministry said on Monday. 

Britain, France and Germany, signatories to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, reimposed sanctions on September 28, triggering in turn the return of UN sanctions under the so-called snapback mechanism.
