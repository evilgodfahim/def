 When it comes to this year's Nobel Peace Prize, one thing is almost certain: US President Donald Trump will not win, no matter how much he wants it. But who will? 

The Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo will bring the suspense to an end when it announces the winner Friday at 11:00 am (0900 GMT).

 An NGO on Wednesday denied claims by the Burkina Faso authorities that its workers had been involved in spying a day after the military regime arrested more of its staff. 

The International and Safety Organisation (INSO) was responding a day after the country's Security Minister Mahamadou Sana accused its staff of "spying and treason".

 Japan's likely new prime minister Sanae Takaichi may skip visiting a shrine honouring war dead this month to avoid angering Asian neighbours, media reports said. 

Past visits by senior politicians to Yasukuni - which honours even convicted war criminals - have angered China and South Korea.

 The EU on Wednesday told European businesses in critical sectors to ramp up their uptake of artificial intelligence and pushed for the bloc to cut its dependence on foreign AI providers. 

Although the European Union is falling behind the United States and China, Brussels believes the bloc can still compete in the global AI race.

 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said Europe must ramp up its defences to deter Russia's "hybrid warfare", after a catalogue of air incursions, cyber attacks and damage to undersea cables. 

"These incidents are calculated to linger in the twilight of deniability. This is not random harassment.

 Beijing sanctioned on Thursday 14 overseas entities, including defence contractors and intelligence firms, accusing them of harming national security and aiding Taiwan.

 Belgian authorities said Thursday they had arrested three young adults for plotting a jihadist-inspired attack using drone-mounted explosives, with Prime Minister Bart De Wever reported to be among several politicians targeted.

 US President Donald Trump said Thursday that Washington and NATO allies were "stepping up the pressure" to end the war in Ukraine, after his outreach to Russia's Vladimir Putin failed to achieve a ceasefire.

 President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that Spain be expelled from NATO over its failure to match the higher defense spending requirement he has engineered. 

"We had one laggard, it was Spain," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. "They have no excuse not to do this, but that's all right. Maybe you should throw them out of NATO frankly."
